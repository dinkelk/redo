#
# Most of these tests were inspired by:
# http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/autoconf/Shell-Substitutions.html
#
# Note that this file isn't really a test for POSIX compliance.  It's a test
# for usefulness-compliance, that is, interpreting POSIX in a particular way
# for consistency, so that users of redo can depend on all the following
# functionality.
#
# Where POSIX makes a clear statement about something working a particular
# way, POSIX wins.  But where POSIX is unclear on a point, I don't mind
# picking a particular way and requiring it here, if that makes writing
# scripts easier for everyone in the future.
