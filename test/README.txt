Notes:

Changes from apwarren include some modifications for a different $2
Test 120-defaults-flat is currently disabled because it required a locking mechanism which I don't currently have
Test 121-defaults-nested is currently disabled because it requires finding default.do's above the current directory. This is TBD.
Test 140-shuffle is currenty disabled. I probably will not end up supporting this option
Test 200-shell/all is current disabled. No support for anything other than sh scripts right now. Needs to be fixed.
Test 141-keep-going/all is currently disabled. not supporting the --keep-going option right now.
Test 220-ifcreate/all is disabled because ifcreate does not exist yet
